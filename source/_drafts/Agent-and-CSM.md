title: How CSM project can benefit from Agent adoption ?
---

:::info
This document is based on the CSM proposal doc  :mega:
:::

The following is a basic example that takes in consideration few variables - but shows how Agent app can facilitate the collaborative economy, taking in account any kind of events done during the supply chain and keeping track of the whole resources flow, enabling a greater level of participation and creation / distribution of value.

| Actors | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| CIRCo   | a start-up liberatory technology and anarcho-industrial cooperative |
| FC Community | Network of people that use or want to boost faircoin usage and adoption  |
| Investor    | Interested in buy large amount of FairCoin, possibly not at community price |
| FabLab    | An external actor that can collaborate with CIRCo during the production phase  |


```sequence

CIRCo --> Fc Community: What goods do you need?
Fc Community --> CIRCo: We need e-bikes
Note over CIRCo,Fc Community: CIRCo defines together with FC Community\n requirements to setup an \ne-bikes manufacturing
Investor -> CIRCo: Lends needed Eur to start\n e-bikes manufacturing
Note left of CIRCo: CIRCo setup a supply chain plan\n and creates a custom\n value equation to \n automatically distribute generated\n value among partecipants\n
CIRCo -> CIRCo: CIRCo Worker 1 creates\n  the e-bike design 
CIRCo -> CIRCo: CIRCo Worker 2 works on \nthe bike skeleton
FabLab -> CIRCo: Sends the needed electric engines
CIRCo -> CIRCo: CIRCo Worker 3 puts\n together the e-bike
Note left of CIRCo: CIRCo releases the first\n production of e-bikes
CIRCo -> Fc Community: Sell e-bikes and receives eur / fair
CIRCo -> CIRCo: The value equation takes in account\n all contributions and split the value\n among partecipants \n according to the formula
CIRCo -> FabLab: Send the corresponding value
CIRCo -> Investor: Pays back the loan in Fair
Note left of CIRCo: CIRCo publishes online the \nsupply-chain recipe to create e-bikes\n to allow other groups\n to start the manufacturing
